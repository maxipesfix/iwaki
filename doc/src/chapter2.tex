This chapter's goal is to quickly get the reader going with the Iwaki installation and the example soundboard application. 

\section{Installing on Unix}

\subsection{Prerequisites}

In addition to the usual packages necessary to build a C++ executable on a Linux platform you will need the following libraries:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ncurses} library (available from Ubuntu repositories).
\item \texttt{RE2} regular expression library. Install it from \url{http://code.google.com/p/re2}
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the Soundboard application plays sounds using gstreamer, so make sure it is installed and runnable via via \texttt{gst-launch-0.10} command.

\subsection{Install Iwaki}

In the root of the Iwaki distribution directory, which we will refer to as \texttt{PROJECTDIR}, examine the file CMakeLists.txt. Make sure it includes the correct location of your RE2 library and header files.

To build the binaries in a directory outside of the source tree, type
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Running Soundboard application}

The soundboard executable should be created in \texttt{PROJECTDIR/build/soundboard/bin}.
You can run it from \texttt{PROJECTDIR/build} by typing the following command line (make sure to replace PROJECTDIR with the actual location of the root of the installed Iwaki distribution).

\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
./soundboard/bin/soundboard -t 0.1 -d DEBUG4 -l log1 -p ../soundboard/scripts -i initialize_im.georgi.xml -s PROJECTDIR/soundboard/sounds -x
\end{lstlisting}

The command line options specify the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \texttt{-h} \hspace{2cm} Prints command line options information

\item[] \texttt{-d -{}-debug level} \hspace{2cm} One of the following debug levels: \texttt{ERROR}, \texttt{WARNING}, \texttt{INFO}, \texttt{DEBUG}, \texttt{DEBUG1}, \texttt{DEBUG2}, \texttt{DEBUG3}, \texttt{DEBUG4}

\item[] \texttt{-t -{}-timer timer\_period} \hspace{2cm} Specifies the period in seconds between calls to Iwaki update.

\item[] \texttt{-l -{}-log path/log\_file\_prefix} \hspace{2cm} If present, this option directs all the debug output to the file prefixed with \texttt{log\_file\_prefix}.

\item[] \texttt{-x -{}-text\_ui} \hspace{2cm} If present, this option enables the text-based user interface displayed in the current terminal window.

\item[] \texttt{-p -{}-path path} \hspace{2cm} Path to IM scripts directory. This directory should contain init file.

\item[] \texttt{-i -{}-init init\_file} \hspace{2cm} If present, overrides the default init file name, initialize\_im.xml. 

\item[] \texttt{-a -{}-atoms defaults\_file} \hspace{2cm} If present, overrides the default atoms file name, default\_atoms.xml. 

\item[] \texttt{-s -{}-sounds path to sound files} \hspace{2cm} Absolute path to the sound file directory.

\end{itemize}


If Soundboard has successfully started you should hear a hearbeat sound at random integer intervals between 1 and 4 seconds. Type ``h'' or ``how'' and press enter to greet the Soundboard character, you should hear a response.
